__My first 3d game ever!__<br/>
A fun (and not easy at all) puzzle game I made in high school. <br/>
The goal is to push the yellow squares off the surface with the help of the red square (More detailed instructions will appear in the game run). <br/>
## installation
Just clone the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Push.git
```
Open the folder with visual studio - and here's the game on your computer.<br/>
If you just want to play and are not interested in the code (which makes sense) there is also an [exe file](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Push/blob/main/Push/Push/bin/Debug/Push.exe).
